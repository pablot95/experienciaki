                <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
                <p>My name is <strong>Erica Dannemann</strong>. Since 2011, I merged all my experience in teaching over twenty-six years with my passion for music, dance, and purpose as the 'guiding thread' — which is to provide a unique and outstanding service to help you transform your awareness.</p>
                <p>It's not that I'm magical — it's that together we create a space that, <strong>YES</strong>, is magical, because when you connect with authenticity, things can't help but happen. I call this 'mystery'.</p>

            <div class="info-content fade-in-up">
                <h3>Experienciaki is not just a massage</h3>
                <p>In each encounter experience, you will find a variety of stimuli designed to bring you into the present moment. We often confuse "disconnecting" with relaxing. However, I've learned through giving sessions that the greatest richness and the true "transmutation" in this experience happens when you are present and become aware of basically "who I am." <strong>That is the true gift of an experienciaki.</strong></p>

                <h3>What makes it different?</h3>
                <p>It's not just a premium technique but a combination of strategies to lead you into a deep encounter with your being through quality of touch, aromas that open portals, sounds that harmonize, music that connects you with your highest frequency, surroundings that remind you of your own beauty and balance, foot baths that help you let go of what's "outside" and no longer serves you, and the most powerful thing of all: the encounter between the therapist and the receiver in a mysterious dance of giving and receiving — both — and the main reason why we "touch," which is to return to the most primal and essential: <strong>TO BREATHE</strong>.</p>
                <p class="highlight-text">It is a love scene. Because Experienciaki is born from the desire, the intention to give love and move your energy to a higher level toward your best version.</p>

                    <p><strong>Experienciaki is not a common decontracting massage.</strong> It has spontaneously positioned itself among its patients as a therapeutic experience. You can do it once a week in regular 1:1 sessions, biweekly, once a month, or whenever you feel like it.</p>
                    <p class="italic-text">This experience is not for everyone. It's not about disconnecting. It's about feeling and being present and conscious, often "going through" a pain that then finds release and an unusual form of well-being.</p>
